## About

The 42 school's __get_next_line__ project is where we learn to read from a __file descriptor__, as well as the use of __static variables__.

This function returns a single line from a given file descriptor. If called in a loop, get_next_line returns the entire contents of a file, __line by line until it reaches the end of the file__. It can be compiled specifying any buffer size.

## Usage
This function is not a stand-alone program, its files must be included and compiled within another project.

Example ``main.c``:
```c
int	main(void)
{
	int		fd;
	char	*line;

	fd = open("test.txt", O_RDONLY);
	if (fd == -1)
	{
		perror("Erreur d'ouverture du fichier");
		return (1);
	}
	while ((line = get_next_line(fd)) != NULL)
	{
		printf("Ligne lue : %s", line);
		free(line);
	}
	close(fd);
	return (0);
}
```
Compilation:
```bash
gcc main.c get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c
```
``BUFFER_SIZE`` can be specified at compilation to override the default ``BUFFER_SIZE``:
```bash
gcc -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 main.c get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c
```
Execution:
```bash
./a.out [file]
```
Output should show the entire contents of the given file.

Execution with stdin:
```bash
./a.out /dev/tty
```
Program will wait for input, then once the enter key is pressed, print out the input as well as get_next_line's output. The process can be killed with ``ctrl-c``.
